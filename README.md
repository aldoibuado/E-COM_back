  ## Description 
  In today's day in age, you are able to purchase items from the comforts of your home. The internet has given stores and small businesses the ability to sell items online. Being able to incorporate API routes and testing them with Insomnia has been a good way to see if they are working correctly. Being able to finish the back end part of an e-commerce website has beneficial in strengthening my skills as a programmer. I learned how to incorporate API routes, use Sequelize and using SQL.

  ## Installation
  The user will need to input npm install and then press enter. The user will also need to input node seeds/index.js, press enter and then also input node server.js, press enter to get the server to connect. 

  ## Usage
  The user will need to download Insomnia. Once Insomnia has been downloaded, the user will use the GET option and input http://locathost:3001/api/ and input categories, products or tags one at a time and click send to see if it will return the requested information. I have attached a link https://youtu.be/BFHrE03wvdw to the video displaying how to different routes function!

  ## Tests
  I did input npx nodemon server.js as a way of resetting things once I changed a function on a route to see what was working and what was not. Then, I opened Insomina and tested the different routes to see if I was getting in return the requested information.

  ## Questions
  What does npx nodemon server.js do?
